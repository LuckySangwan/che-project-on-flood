<h1>Introduction to Floods</h1>
    </div>
<h2>Floods</h2>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1327503600/vector/storm-is-destroying-the-city.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=pu1l1ZSj0uw0etu4bM8QnPrTBwzLhnquH_kI7SexDJM=" >

<p>A flood is an overflow of water (or rarely other fluids) that submerges land that is usually dry. In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding, for example land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees, and larger environmental issues such as climate change and sea level rise. In particular climate change's increased rainfall and extreme weather events increases the severity of other causes for flooding, resulting in more intense floods and increased flood risk.</p>


<h2>What are the causes of a flood?</h2>


<h3>Massive rainfall</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-06-18T115028Z_767422988_RC28UU90B5Z2_RTRMADP_3_BANGLADESH-FLOODS.jpg?resize=1170%2C780&quality=80">
<p>During severe rains, drainage systems and effective infrastructure design are of great assistance. They make it possible to drain excess water into reservoirs in a straightforward manner. However, when there is a lot of rain, the systems become inoperable. As a result, a deluge occurs.</p>


<h3>Overflowing of the rivers</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/538158074/photo/stormy-river-flooding-the-forest.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=D6mNTN6-4HhI7gOHQ96yzVmVvTscqd2DYcDf8ejkzPI=">
<p>The people who live beside the river are always at risk of losing their lives due to the overflowing of the rivers. A series of dams is constructed in order to avoid such a situation. However, if these dams are not adequately maintained, they can cause flooding and significant damage.</p>


<h3>Collapsed dams</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lYbFLBqJXVc/maxresdefault.jpg">
<p>When heavy rains fall, the dams that have been constructed begin to fail. Thus, the flood scenario for the people living in the surrounding area becomes even more critical.</p>


<h3>Snowmelt</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://floodlist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/snowmelt-floods-Kazakhstan-april-2015.jpg">
<p>Flooding occurs when there is a rapid melting of snow owing to significant precipitation and other circumstances, resulting in the accumulation of water. Adoption of long-term solutions for dealing with excessive precipitation can aid in the management of the flooding issue.</p>


<h3>Deforestation</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://smallwomanatlarge.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/20201225_151555.jpg?w=1568">
<p>Cutting down trees in a careless manner, often known as deforestation, is a significant contributor to man-made flooding. Soil erosion and crop loss are both prevented by the presence of trees in the landscape. The vegetation is also becoming more diverse as a result of the increase in the number of trees. This also serves to block the torrential downpours, preventing flooding.</p>


<h3>Climate change</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/412374C5-2AB1-4CFC-8D857BB8F7705AB6_source.jpg?w=590&h=800&AD601E5C-89F3-43B4-A407A5EDABD65968">
<p>Human-induced climate change increases the likelihood of floods, which is exacerbated further by human activities. Human beings cut down a vast number of trees, which has a negative impact on the photosynthetic process. As a result, increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere induce climate change, increasing the likelihood of natural disasters such as floods and other natural disasters.</p>


<h3>Emission of greenhouse gases</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://skepticalscience.com/graphics/impacts_US_1000.jpg">
<P>In addition to degrading the ozone layer by burning fossil fuels, industrial impacts and pollution are contributing to the increase in greenhouse gases, which is becoming a major source of man-made flooding.</P>


<h2>Impacts of flood</h2>
<p>The most immediate effect of a flood is the catastrophic loss of life and destruction of buildings and other structures like bridges, sewerage systems, canals etc.</p>
<p>Floods also damage power transmission and sometimes power generation along loss of drinking water treatment and water supply  Lack of clean water combined with human sewage in the flood waters raises the risk of waterborne diseases, which can include typhoid, cholera and many other diseases depending upon the location of the flood.</p>
<p>
    <li>Flood waters typically inundate farm land, making the land unworkable and preventing crops from being planted or harvested, which can lead to shortages of food both for humans and farm animals.</li>
<li>Entire harvests for a country can be lost in extreme flood circumstances. Some tree species may not survive prolonged flooding of their root systems.
    Secondary and long-term effects</li>
    <li>Economic hardship due to a temporary decline in tourism, rebuilding costs, or food shortages leading to price increases is a common after-effect of severe flooding.</li>
</p>



<h1 class="container">Types of flood</h1>
<p>There are three common flood types: fluvial floods, also known as river floods; pluvial or flash floods; and coastal floods, which are often called storm surge. Each type of flood occurs and is forecast in different ways. The impacts of each type of flood are also different and so are the actions you need to take to avoid or minimize flooding damage.</p>

<h2><li>Fluvial floods (river floods)</li></h2>
<p>A fluvial, or river flood, occurs when the water level in a river, lake or stream rises and overflows onto the neighboring land. The water level rise of the river could be due to excessive rain or snowmelt.</p>
<p>The damage from a river flood can be widespread as the overflow affects smaller rivers downstream, which can cause dams and dikes to break and swamp nearby areas.</p>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/industry-knowledge/flood-and-water-damage/images/infographic-fluvial-or-river-flood.jpg?rev=e4ae117a400c412a883a3a48e8128cff&hash=C1E289D4E20B11D0E0F676889DA64845">
<p>To determine the probability of river flooding, models consider past precipitation, forecasted precipitation, current river levels, as well as soil and terrain conditions.</p>
<p>The severity of a river flood is determined by the terrain profile and the duration and intensity (volume) of rainfall in the rivers catchment area. Other factors include soil water saturation and climate change effects on rainfall duration and intensity. In flat areas, floodwater tends to rise more slowly and be shallower, but it can often remain for days. In hilly or mountainous areas, floods can occur within minutes after a heavy rain, drain very quickly and cause damage due to debris flow.</p>

<h2><li>Pluvial floods (flash floods and surface water)</li>
</h2>
<p>A pluvial flood occurs when an extreme rainfall event creates a flood independent of an overflowing water body. A common misconception about flood is that you must be located near a body of water to be at risk. Yet pluvial flooding can happen in any location, urban or rural, even in areas with no nearby bodies of water.
</p>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/industry-knowledge/flood-and-water-damage/images/infographic-pluvial-floods-flash-floods-and-surface-water.jpg?rev=a46c1ad275d046269f7d56bfef5857ea&hash=0FAFA17DADCA25442FA115C7927691C3">
<h3>There are two common types of pluvial flooding:</h3>
<h4>Surface water floods</h4>
<p>Surface water floods occur when an urban drainage system is overwhelmed and water flows out into streets and nearby structures. It occurs gradually, which provides people time to move to safe locations, and the level of water is usually shallow (rarely more than 1 meter deep). It creates no immediate threat to lives but may cause significant economic damage.</p>
<h4>Flash floods </h4>
<p>Flash floods are characterized by an intense, high velocity torrent of water triggered by torrential rain falling within a short amount of time within the vicinity or on nearby elevated terrain. They can also occur via a sudden release of water from an upstream levee or a dam. Flash floods are very dangerous and destructive not only because of the force of the water, but also the hurtling debris that is often swept up in the flow</p>


<h2><li>Coastal flood (storm surge)</li></h2>
<p>Coastal flooding is the inundation of land areas along the coast by seawater. Common causes of coastal flooding are intense windstorm events occurring at the same time as high tide (storm surge), and tsunamis</p>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/industry-knowledge/flood-and-water-damage/images/infographic-coastal-floods-and-storm-surge.jpg?rev=15516d0e2de54752bdfd4af189003661&hash=DAD4DAB64291350A0EB5AFF7A2384B06">
<p>Storm surge is created when high winds from a windstorm force water onshore - this is the leading cause of coastal flooding and often the greatest threat associated with a hurricane or typhoon. The effects increase depending on the tide - windstorms that occur during high tide can result in devastating storm surge floods. In this type of flood, water overwhelms low-lying land and often causes devastating loss of life and property.</p>

<h1 class="container">IMPACT OF FLOOD ON THE ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<ol>
<h2><li> Impact on Wildlife</li></h2>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://langhornecreekfloods.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/20640-6a0120a607c3bf970c0133f4c62fde970b-pi.jpg">
<p>The volume of water running through our rivers may wash out fish and their fry who can become stranded when the water recedes. The storms will also have washed a great deal of sediment into rivers which reduces the oxygen levels – unsuitable habitat for fish, such as salmon, to spawn. Otters and other wetland mammals will also have been displaced and will be struggling.</p>
<h2><li>Impact on Water quality</li></h2>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.aquaread.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sewer-system-flooding.jpeg">
<P>As contaminated flood water reaches rivers, lakes, wetlands, and oceans, the aquatic organisms there can suffer. If industrial chemicals and agricultural pesticides reach these bodies of water, they can become heavily polluted, and harmful algal blooms form.</P>
<p>Sediment carried in flood water can then settle at the bottom, clogging riverbeds and changing habitats for the worst.</p>
<p>’s important to note that sometimes, natural flooding carries vital nutrients and helps renew ecosystems. But in a world so heavily polluted and where flooding is increasing by the day, it’s hard to ignore the largely harmful effects on water quality and, indeed, human life.</p>
<P>As water quality deteriorates, so too does our access to clean crops, seafood, and drinking water. It goes without saying, then, that it’s crucial to address the reasons behind flooding and to create flood-resilient architecture and infrastructure!</P>
<h2><li>Impact on crops</li></h2>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alfred-Dongzagla/publication/301535364/figure/fig3/AS:415410328489987@1476052948426/Effects-of-floods-on-food-crop-farming.png">
<p></p>
<h3><ol><li>Physiological Effects of Flood</li></h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://assets.corteva.com/is/image/Corteva/flooded_conditions?wid=250&hei=141">
<p>Research in flooded soils has shown that the oxygen concentration approaches zero after 24 hours (however, moderate water movement allows some oxygen to get to the plants, and damage is not as severe.)</p>
<p>Without oxygen,  the plant cannot perform critical life-sustaining functions such as respiration, water uptake, root growth, etc. Water-logging also leads to accumulations of compounds like CO2, which are toxic to plants in high concentrations.</p>
<h3><li>Type of Crop and Duration of Flooding</li></h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334680805/figure/fig2/AS:784584845295625@1564071012806/Fig-4-Crops-Damage-due-to-Flood-Ref-27-Ref-28.jpg">
<p>Most crops grown in the U.S. are intolerant of flooding (rice being the obvious exception). But differences exist between crops in how they respond to flooding. Very susceptible crops include potatoes and dry beans, which may succumb after only one day under water (Glogoza, 2005). Small grains such as wheat often withstand at least one day of flooding or two days of completely saturated soils (Peel, 2000). The major crops grown in the Midwest, corn and soybeans, fare somewhat better, often surviving two to four days of flooding without requiring replant. Soybeans are thought to be more tolerant of temporary flooding than corn and many other crops (Berglund, 2005; Iowa State Extension, 1998; Stanley, 1980.) </p>
<h3><li>Growth Stage</li></h3>
<p>Growth stage is a critical factor in survivability due to flooding. Technically, the larger a plant, the more oxygen it requires to stay alive. Practically, however, smaller plants are more likely to become submerged and to remain submerged for longer periods. As a rule, smaller crops in the earliest growth stages are more at risk and are usually more damaged by flooding, ponding and saturated soils</p>
<h3><li>Diseases</li></h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://flooddiseases.com/images/blog/fig2.jpg">
<p>Cool, wet soils are most conducive to disease development. These conditions are not only optimal for some soil pathogens, but also delay emergence and plant development. These delays keep seedlings from out-growing damage by soil-borne diseases that attack seeds and seedlings. Seed treatments can help, but are generally limited to about two weeks of protection. If cool, wet conditions persist longer than two to three weeks, crop stands are at risk.</p>
<p>In addition to seedling diseases like Pythium, other diseases may also infect the plant during flooding, but their symptoms may not be evident until much later</p>
<h3><li>Conditions After Flooding</li></h3>
<p>Weather conditions following flooding are often just as important to plant survival as conditions during flooding. Prolonged saturation of soils will further stress oxygen-starved roots. Cool temperatures allow root and seedling diseases to progress while plant growth is minimized. Cool, cloudy conditions also limit plant recovery from physical damage caused by silt and crop debris.</p>
<P>On the opposite extreme are hot and windy conditions following flooding. Rapid soil drying under these conditions can cause crusting that restricts plant growth. Continued drying or "baking" of soils is especially stressful if prolonged soil saturation has resulted in root die-back or severely limited root system expansion.</P>
<p>Growers should carefully assess crop damage and check with their agronomist and crop insurance agent before tearing up the existing stand and replanting. Crops that look yellow and weak can often recover, especially with ideal weather conditions. If plant meristems remain firm and healthy, the chance of survival is high - if meristematic tissues are soft and discolored, recovery is not likely . New growth may require several days after water drains from the field, so patience is often required to make the best decision.</p>

<h2><li>Impact on Trees</li></h2>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://nfs.unl.edu/images/CFSL/tree-uprooted-flooding.jpg">
<p>Flooding may cause direct damage to trees by changing soil conditions, interrupting normal oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange between trees and their environment, sedimentation and physical damage.</p>
<p>Flooding also can weaken trees, making them more susceptible to damage from insects and diseases. The likelihood of insect and disease damage depends upon the severity of the flood and tree health. A tree in weak condition before a flood can be further stressed by flooding.</p>
<p>Trees that are flood stressed exhibit a range of symptoms that may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Leaf chlorosis (yellowing), followed by leaf loss.</li>
    <li>Reduced leaf size.</li>
    <li>Early fall coloration and leaf drop.</li>
    <li>Watersprouts or small shoots emerging from the main stem</li>
    <li>Crown dieback.</li>
    <li>Large seed crops or no seed crops in years following a flood</li>

<h2>Some of the cases are</h2>
<ul>
<h3><li>1931 China Floods</li></h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Hankow_city_hall.jpg">
<p>The <b>1931 China floods,</b> or the <b>1931 Yangtze–Huai River floods,</b> occurred from June to August 1931 in China, hitting major cities such as Wuhan, Nanjing and beyond, and eventually culminated in a dike breach along Lake Gaoyou on 25 August 1931.

    Fatality estimates vary widely. A field survey by the University of Nanking led by John Lossing Buck immediately after the flood found "150,000 people had drowned, and that this number represented less than a quarter of all fatalities during the first 100 days of the flood."[2] The official report found 140,000 drowned[3] and claims that "2 million people died during the flood, having drowned or died from lack of food".[4] A cholera epidemic in the subsequent year, from May 1932, was officially reported to have 31,974 deaths and 100,666 cases.[5] While frequently featured in the list of disasters in China by death toll, a popular high-end estimate of 3.7 to 4.0 million fatalities is instrumental in "helping the 1931 flood to secure its position on sensationalist lists of the world’s deadliest disasters."</p>

<h3><li>1938 Yellow River flood</li></h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG-4-Yellow-River-refugees1.jpg">
<p>The <b>1938 Yellow River flood</b> was a man-made flood from June 1938 to January 1947 created by the Chinese National Army's intentional destruction of dikes (levees) on the Yellow River. The first wave of floods hit Zhongmu County on 13 June 1938.</p>
<p>The flood acted as a scorched-earth defensive line in the Second Sino-Japanese War. There were three long-term strategic intents. Firstly, the flood in Henan safeguarded the Shaanxi section of the Longhai railway, the major northwest traffic where the Soviet Union sent their military supplies to the Chinese National Army from August 1937 to March 1941. Secondly, the inundated land and railway made it difficult for the Japanese Army to mobilize into Shaanxi, thereby preventing them from entering the Sichuan basin, where the wartime capital of Chongqing and the southwestern home front was located.[6] Thirdly, the floods in Henan and Anhui crushed the tracks and bridges of the Beijing–Wuhan Railway, Tianjin–Pukou Railway and Longhai Railway, thereby preventing the Japanese Army from mobilizing their machines and troops across the theaters of North China, Central China and Northwest China.[7] The short term strategic intent was to stop the quick mobilization of Japanese Army from North China into the Battle of Wuhan.[7][8][9][10]

    The flood achieved the above strategic intent; in particular, the Japanese Operation 5 never captured Shaanxi, Sichuan or Chongqing. However, the flood came at human cost, economic damages and environmental impact: in the immediate aftermath, 30,000 to 89,000 civilians drowned in Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, while a total of 400,000 to 500,000 civilians died from drowning, famine and plague.</p>
<p>he Yellow River was diverted to a new course over swathes of farmland until the repair of the dykes in January 1947. Five million civilians lived on such inundated land until 1947. Inspired by the strategic outcome, dykes elsewhere in China, especially along the Yangtze, were later destroyed by the Chinese and the Japanese.</p>

<h3><li>1935 Yangtze flood</li></h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/4521fb4a742741fb811f4f7cb354113a/info/thumbnail/ago_downloaded.png?w=800"> 
<p>The 1935 Yangtze flood struck China during a decade of flooding, famine and social turmoil. It is considered to be the fifth deadliest flood in recorded history, with a death toll of 145,000 and displacement of millions. As a result of the flood, millions of survivers were faced with hardship due to displacement, injury, loss of property as well as food shortages and famine.</p>
<p>Four years earlier in 1931, after three years of drought, both the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers experienced significant flooding. Known as the 1931 China Floods, they were considered to be the worst non-pandemic disaster of the century because of the millions of deaths they led to indirectly. With the 1935 floods following on so soon from the 1931 floods, flood relief infrastructure, which included drainage reservoirs and floodwater channels, was soon overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River flooding primarily affected the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, all of which are located in the middle to lower reaches of the river</p>

<h3><li>St. Lucia's flood</li></h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NNkOF_g6sWc/maxresdefault.jpg">
<p>St. Lucia's flood (Sint-Luciavloed) was a storm tide that affected the Netherlands and Northern Germany on 13/14 December 1287 (OS), St. Lucia Day and the day after, killing approximately 50,000 to 80,000 people in one of the largest floods in recorded history.

    This disaster was similar to the North Sea flood of 1953, when an intense European windstorm coinciding with a high tide caused a huge storm surge. The St. Lucia flood had a major influence on the subsequent history of the Netherlands.</p>

<h3><li>1949 Eastern Guatemalan floods</li></h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://floodlist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/floods-Cajol%C3%A1-Quetzaltenango-Guatemala-18-May-2020-CONRED-343x187.jpeg">
<p>On October 14–16, 1949, a series of violent and devastating floods killed an estimated 1,000 to 40,000 people in Central America, principally Guatemala. Estimates of the death toll ranged from 1,000 to 40,000, with reliable estimates suggesting 4,000 fatalities, placing the floods as some of the deadliest in recorded history. Estimated monetary losses ranged from $15,000,000 to $40,000,000.</p>
<p>Landslides and road blockages affected communications within the country, and also impacted distribution of foods and other resources. As news of the floodings in Guatemala broke international headlines, Foreign governments pledged aid to the recovery of the country accordingly. The neighbouring countries of The United States and Cuba rushed to provide immediate aid by plane to victims of the disaster</p>

<p> Flooding is Canada’s most costly type of natural disaster<li> Flooding is responsible for extreme damage and destruction to property, public areas, and the environment which incurs enormous costs for government. In addition to damage costs, flooding results in lost productivity, reduced hours worked, and losses in GDP, due to the need for resources to be put toward recovery efforts and away from daily activities.</li>
</p>
<p>In 2015, the Parliamentary Budget Office reported that flooding cost the Federal “Disaster Financial Assistance Agreements” (DFAA) program $673 million between 2005-2014. <li> Between them, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba represented 80% of DFAA weather costs over that period. It is worth noting that these costs do not represent the full cost of flooding, only the federal taxpayers’ contribution to those costs. The costs are also increasing as the number of catastrophic weather events increases, due to a changing climate. In previous decades, “the cost of weather-related disasters was roughly equivalent to one per cent of Canada’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In the last decade, disaster costs have climbed to between five and six per cent of annual GDP growth.”</li></p>
<p> <li>A 2020 report suggests that that some 836 thousand (~7.7%) Canadian properties are at a “high risk” of flooding</li> </p>
<ul>
<h2><li>Temporary or Permanent Loss of Business/Wage</li></h2>
<p>When catastrophic flooding occurs, normal economic activity is severely disrupted. For example, in the Southern Alberta June 2013 flood, businesses along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood, and Oldman Rivers, as well as local tributaries, were forced to shut down and evacuate. Southern Alberta’s largest city centre, downtown Calgary, was forced to shut down for nearly one week in order for flood waters to recede and for the area to be considered safe for re-entry. While many Albertans were able to continue working remotely or from home, many industries, such as the service industry, were unable to work from home, resulting in lost revenue and wages. Analysis from Statistics Canada found that in the final two weeks of June, approximately 300,000 Albertans (13.5% of the employed population in Alberta) lost 7.5 million hours of work. Total hours lost by each industry is shown below:</p>

<p>While wage and productivity losses are most pronounced in the immediate period of a flood, some businesses find recovery takes many months, or they simply never re-open. The impacts of flooding can be devastating for any city, region, or country, and the resultant economic losses can be damaging to the overall economy and well-being of citizens. However, the recovery and rebuilding efforts that occur after a flood may compensate for lost revenue and/or business that occurred during the flood.</p>

<h2><li>Intangible and Indirect Damage</li></h2>
<p>Indirect damage includes things such as “costs of evacuation, employment losses, administrative costs, net loss of normal profit and earnings to capital, management and labour, general inconvenience, etc.”</p>
<h2><li>Increase of Business</li></h2>
<p>Paradoxically, flooding (or any other disaster) can also be good for some businesses. Southern Alberta’s June 2013 flood resulted in an increase in business outside of the flood zone and, despite negative economic impacts, resulted in a GDP boost for Alberta, due to reconstruction efforts, p.4. Businesses located outside the flood-impacted areas or evacuated zones may have experienced an increase in business, as flood-affected businesses were unable to provide goods and services. While the flood had direct negative impacts on Alberta’s economy, indirect impacts increased business activities both outside of the flood zone and after flood waters receded.</p>

<h1>Flood Prevention and Safety</h1>
<h2>FLOOD SAFETY TIPS </h2>
<h3>BEFORE A FLOOD</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/public-safety-and-emergency-services/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/embc/preparedbc/decorative-graphics/know-your-hazards/floods/flood-mitigation-steps-large.png">

<ul>
<li>Avoid building in high-risk flood plain areas to minimize your exposure.</li>
<li>Know the elevation of your property in relation to nearby bodies of water.  If your home is not on high ground, know how to get to high ground quickly.</li>
<li>Be aware of flood watches and warnings.  If a flood watch or warning has been issued, move your family to high ground. In some cases, flood insurance will reimburse you for the cost of moving and temporarily storing the contents of your home.</li>
<li>REMEMBER: YOUR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY DOES NOT COVER FLOOD DAMAGE.  If you decide to buy flood insurance, consider insuring your home for 100% of the replacement cost and be sure to buy coverage to cover the contents of your home.</li>
<li>Stay informed about weather conditions both where you are and upstream.  Distant rain or snowmelt can cause a flood headed in your direction in minutes</li>
<li>Elevate your furnace and water heater so that they are less likely to be affected in a flood.</li>
<li>Consider installing “check valves” to prevent floodwater from backing up into the drains of your home.</li>
<li>Seal your basement walls with waterproof material to help protect your home.</li>
<li>Construct barriers to stop floodwater from entering your home</li>
<li>Build an emergency kit for your family containing such items as drinking water and nonperishable food for each member of your family (two-week supply), flashlights,  a radio, extra batteries, a first-aid kit, necessary medications, personal hygiene items and copies of important documents.</li>
<li>Create a communication plan so family members can reach one another.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<h3>DURING THE FLOOD</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/toolkits/images/carousel_ready_flood.jpg">
<li>Get information from the radio or television</li>
<li>Move immediately to higher ground if there is any possibility of a flash flood. Do not wait for instructions to move.</li>
<li>If you need to evacuate, secure your home and move essential items to an upper floor</li>
<li>Turn off utilities if instructed to do so, and disconnect electrical appliances. However, do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water.</li>
<li>Do not walk through moving water if it is above your knees— it can make you fall. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you</li>
<li>Do not drive into flooded areas.  If the vehicle stalls, you and the vehicle may be swept away.  If you are caught in your vehicle in floodwater, abandon your car immediately and climb to higher ground.</li>
<li>Be aware that flood water may be contaminated by oil, chemicals, gasoline or sewage.  </li>
<li>If you have evacuated your home, do not return until authorities tell you it is safe.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3>AFTER THE FLOOD</h3>
<img class="flood_image" src="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-10/floodcleanup_w1440.jpg">
<li>If you have flood insurance, contact your insurance company as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Make sure your city’s water supply is safe to drink.  If not, drink only boiled water.</li>
<li>Discard any fresh food that may be contaminated by floodwaters.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect everything that was in contact with floodwater</li>
<li>Floodwater can be contaminated by oil, gasoline or sewage, so avoid contact as much as possible.</li>
<li>Stay away from disaster areas so your do not impede rescue efforts or other emergency efforts.</li>
</ul>
